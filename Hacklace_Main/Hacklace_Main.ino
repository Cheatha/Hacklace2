// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  HL.initialize();
  
  // only for debugging purposes: 
  // ALWAYS restore default EEPROM content after a reset
  //HL.copyToEeprom(ee_default, sizeof(ee_default));
}


// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:

    HL.run();
  }

  HL.goToSleep();      // save battery power
